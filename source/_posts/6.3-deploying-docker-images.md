You can also deploy fully-backed Docker images — for examples those created by your continuous integration system.

Images **must** be pushed to Docker hub (or a private registry) prior to deployment on Deis.

> **Note:** support for Docker registry authentication is coming soon. This means your image _must_ be public.

## Build and Push The Image

As with using a `Dockerfile`, you must still adhere to the following when deploying to Deis:

1. The docker image must `EXPOSE` only one port
2. The port **must** be listening for a HTTP connection
3. A default `CMD` must be specified for running the container

Once you have a `Dockerfile` that meets this criteria, you can build the docker image like so:

```sh
$ docker build -t <username>/<image> .
$ docker push <username>/<image>:latest
```

## Deploying to Deis

To deploy, we must first create an application on the controller, which requires a local working directory:

```sh
$ mkdir -p /tmp/app-name
$ cd /tmp/app-name
$ deis create
```

> **Note:** The deis client uses the name of the current directory as the default app name.

Then you can have Deis simply pull the image and deploy it:

```sh
$ deis pull <username>/<image>:latest
```

To verify that it deployed successfully, you can run deis open to pull up the site in your browser.
