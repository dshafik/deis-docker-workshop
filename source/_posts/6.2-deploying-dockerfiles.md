In addition to using the pre-defined buildpacks, you can create a completely custom environment by deploying a `Dockerfile`. This will build the docker image on the Deis cluster and deploy it.

To use a `Dockerfile`, simply add it to the root of your repository.

## Create a Dockerfile

There are three rules that _must_ be adhered to for deploying a `Dockerfile` to Deis:

1. The Dockerfile must `EXPOSE` only one port
2. The port **must** be listening for a HTTP connection
3. A default `CMD` must be specified for running the container

Here we create a simple `Dockerfile` that installs `jekyll` and serves up an example blog:

```docker
FROM ubuntu:wily

RUN apt-get update -qq
RUN apt-get install -y -q ruby ruby-dev ruby-posix-spawn python-pygments git build-essential nodejs
RUN gem install -V rdiscount jekyll

RUN git clone https://github.com/maciakl/Sample-Jekyll-Site.git blog
WORKDIR blog

EXPOSE 4000

CMD ["jekyll", "serve", "-H", "0.0.0.0"]
```

## Deploying to Deis

As when deploying using a buildpack, you simply need to create the application, and push to it.

```sh
$ deis create
$ git push deis master
```

To verify that it deployed successfully, you can run deis open to pull up the site in your browser.
