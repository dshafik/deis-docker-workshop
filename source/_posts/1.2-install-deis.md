We'll need both `deis` (the Deis CLI) and `deisctl` (the Deis provision tool). Both clients are
automatically built when we ship new releases of Deis, and be grabbed with our install scripts.

> **Note:** To find out the latest version of Deis, simply go to the [releases page](https://github.com/deis/deis/releases)

```console
$ curl -sSL http://deis.io/deisctl/install.sh | sh -s <version> # e.g. 1.6.1
$ curl -sSL http://deis.io/deis-cli/install.sh | sh
```

Both scripts will dump the binaries in the current working directory. We probably want them somewhere
else:
```console
$ mv ./deis* /usr/local/bin/
```

### Clone Deis

* [Fork deis](https://github.com/deis/deis/fork) to your account
* Clone Deis: 

```sh
git clone git@github.com:<username>/deis.git
cd deis
```

> **Note:** replace `<username>` with your github username

Make sure we're using the correct version of the code (as used above)

```sh
$ git fetch --tags
$ git checkout v<version>
```
